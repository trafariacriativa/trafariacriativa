            <p class="section-text">The non-linearity of a community siding the non-linearity of Time itself. The
                Present, Past, and Future of
                Trafaria, as a resurrected point, as an evolving, technological, advanced, creative, and willful land
                that
                refuses to stray from its memories, its history, and its unique personality.</p>
            <p class="section-text">A genuine and honest portrait, conceptually deconstructed and artistically
                regurgitated, of a
                simultaneously ancient and new Trafaria, simultaneously small and vast, simultaneously forgotten and
                remembered.</p>
            <p class="section-text">Remembered not only by those who tell its stories, but always by those who tread its
                sidewalk for the first
                time, and by those who cross the river to discover it.</p>
            <p class="section-text">No one tells the story of a people and a place better than their Women. Through the
                uncontrolled and
                unscripted words shared by the Women of Trafaria - in this 20’s decade of the 21st century that we are
                now traveling through - “Our land is a woman" immortalizes the fervor, the beauty, the heartbreaks, the
                projections, the tears, the culture, the food, the colors, the beach, the river, the courage, and the
                local
                kindness, subsequently washed by the artist's eye, structured by a technological approach from scratch,
                intimately connected to her generation, unilaterally converging distinct intentions and patterns,
                filtering
                them through an unpredictable, disruptive, and beautiful magnifying glass.</p>
            <p class="section-text">In their particularities, ages, nationalities, life experiences, mannerisms, and
                even religions, it is in the
                differences that we understand what unites us - in a non-linear, non-dotted way, flowing between various
                worlds and temporal states. Just like Past, Present and Future, which do not move through Time in a
                straight line, in Trafaria we also find this non-linearity in its people, in its Women, in its direct
                gaze towards
                Lisbon.</p>
            <p class="section-text">This project materializes through a multidisciplinary intersection between sound
                design, field recording
                techniques, video, and digital visual arts, using image and audio editing software, analog musical
                instruments, and technological equipment. It results in a format somewhere between experimental
                cinema and interactive art installation that invites the viewer to be part of the creative process, and
                engage with it.</p>
            <p class="section-text">Projected alongside Trafaria Criativa through mutual interaction and exchange of
                ideas, the object of
                study was the Trafaria community itself. The final result is "returned" to its people, so they can find
                themselves in it, interact with it, and through it, reflect on the local intangible symbols of identity
                and
                heritage, valuing them and connecting them with the technological advancement.</p>
            <p class="section-text">Is it performance? Is it Cinema? Is it sound design? Is it installation? Is it
                music?
                It can be a little bit of everything, as long as it remains as genuine as we are.</p>

            <h3 class="section-subtitle">Biography</h3>

            <p class="section-text">Artist, Producer, Curator, Cultural Manager, Portuguese, female, Trafaria resident.
                With over 14 years of experience in artistic event production, and as a cultural manager and Curator,
                Sara
                Wual Barros has dedicated herself to developing creative work at the multidisciplinary intersection of
                Music, Visual Art, Poetry, Sound design, and Technology since 2022.</p>
            <p class="section-text">From experimenting with analog Electronic Music, to Contemporary Art exhibitions and
                even Cinema,
                her career is marked by a diversity of mediums, forms of expression, fields of study, and working
                methods,
                always driven by a thoughtful, scrutinized, and up-to-date reflection on social issues that mirror the
                present times.</p>
            <p class="section-text">Her aesthetics are meant for people to feel a deep respect, acknowledgement and
                praise to the origins of
                underground music and arts culture, hand in hand with a grounding approach to what is currently
                happening in the world. In her research work and creative processes, the artist strives for empowering,
                representing and creating safe spaces for communities belonging to underrepresented minorities, while
                sparking awareness about climate action and social fairness.</p>
            <p class="section-text">Past, Present and Future are always embedded in her work, regardless of the mediums
                used.
                Her approach to Art and artistic creation combines a disruptive and an imaginative perspective, in a
                constant search for beauty and the ephemeral, carrying a mutable and realistic stance that never
                distances itself from the tangible, nor from Society itself.</p>
